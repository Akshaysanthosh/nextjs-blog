Special thanks to [Lee Rob](https://github.com/leerob) for creating such a beautiful theme that is very well structured and looks amazing on all devices. All the design inspiration and MDX structure come from him.

If you're interested in learning Next.js and building real-world applications with it, I strongly suggest taking Lee's course [React 2025](https://react2025.com). I have taken it myself and can vouch for it.
